# Feature Audit

A complete, honest inventory of every Blink command and subsystem, written
for the v1.0 stabilization pass (Phase 9) and kept current since. For each
area: what it's for, its status, how it's used, what it depends on, and its
maintenance cost. The last two sections record what this audit decided to
**keep, merge, or cut**, and why.

Measured on the current build (v0.6.1): **14 crates**, **236 unique
transitive dependencies** (251 `Cargo.lock` packages minus the 15 workspace
members), and a **4.6 MB release binary**. Against a clean checkout of this
repo, `blink benchmark --runs 5` reports roughly **7 ms startup · 2 ms scan
· 4 ms cold analysis · 7 ms cached**, stable across repeated warm runs on
one Windows machine. Re-run it rather than trusting those four numbers —
they are a snapshot of one machine, and on a project this small the cached
path (which re-hashes every file to validate the entry) costs about as much
as the analysis it replaces.

## How to read the tables

- **Status** — `stable` (shipped, tested, documented), `thin` (works, but
  intentionally shallow), or `at-risk` (candidate for change; see notes).
- **Maint. cost** — rough ongoing burden: `low` (pure function over
  existing data), `med` (owns some logic/IO), `high` (long-running
  runtime, external process, or platform-specific code).

## Commands

### Getting started

| Command | Purpose | Status | Depends on | Maint. cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `init` | Write a `blink.toml` seeded with the detected project name. | stable | core | low |
| `scan` | Detect language/framework/package-manager/counts. | stable | core | low |
| `inspect` | One-screen "what is this / how to run / where to start". | stable | core, index, workflow | med |
| `doctor` | Verify runtimes/tools/env-var *names* are present. | stable | core, workflow | med |
| `setup` | Copy `.env.example`→`.env`, install deps (asks first). | stable | core, workflow, proc | med |

### Context engine

| Command | Purpose | Status | Depends on | Maint. cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `context` | Build the context graph; print the understanding report. | stable | context (→ core, index, workflow) | med |
| `query` | Ranked lexical search over the graph, grouped by kind. | stable | context, query | low |
| `explain` | One file's doc, symbols, imports, and importers. | stable | context | low |
| `map` | Areas plus the area→area edges between them. | stable | context, export | low |
| `export` | Serialize the graph to JSON/YAML/Markdown/Mermaid. | stable | context, export | low |

All five build the same `ContextGraph` and then read from it; only `context`
owns construction. Every edge comes from an import that resolved to a real
project file — an unresolvable import is dropped, never guessed at.

| `benchmark` | Measure Blink's own performance (real numbers). | stable | analyzer, cache | low |

### Meta

| Command | Purpose | Status | Depends on | Maint. cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `plugins` | List/install subprocess plugins. | stable | plugin | low |

## Overlap analysis — kept deliberately

Several commands look adjacent but answer different questions. They were
**kept** rather than merged, because each has a distinct, documented job
and merging would make the survivor do too much:

- **`analyze` / `deps` / `health` / `recommend`** — all read the same
  `AnalysisReport`, but they're *focused views* (a v0.4 design decision,
  not accidental duplication): `deps` is dependency tables, `health` is
  the scored breakdown, `recommend` is categorized actions, `analyze` is
  the full report. No logic is duplicated — they share one engine.
- **`optimize` vs `recommend`/`health`** — `optimize` adds structure,
  duplicate-file, and test/docs/config checks (from the index) that the
  dependency-only commands don't have, and scores them separately.
- **`check` vs `ci`** — `check` *runs your toolchain* (fmt/lint/tests);
  `ci` runs Blink's *analysis* and returns 0/1/2 exit codes. Different
  work, different audience.
- **`filesystem` vs `clean`** — `filesystem` reports where bytes live;
  `clean` deletes regenerable ones. Report vs. action.
- **`run` vs `watch`** — `run` is a dev server *with* watching; `watch`
  is analysis-only reload with no server.
- **`doctor` / `config-audit` / `config check`** — environment tools vs.
  standard project files present vs. Blink's own config validity. Three
  different questions.

**Conclusion:** no commands were removed. The audit found volume, not
redundancy — the 1.0 fix is *organization* (a grouped `--help`, this
document, and the refreshed docs), not amputation. If the project owner
wants a smaller surface, the safest candidates to *hide from top-level
help* (not delete) would be `scan` (largely subsumed by `inspect`) and
`build` (thin until the v0.7 bundler lands) — flagged here, not acted on.

## Dependency & tech-debt notes

- **No unnecessary dependencies** were added in the v0.5 work. `rayon`
  (parallel hashing in `blink-index`), `clap_complete` (completions),
  `sha2`/`hex` (content hashing) are each used on a real path. The v0.6
  context engine added **no new external crates at all** —
  `blink-context` reuses `serde`/`rayon`/`toml`, `blink-query` depends
  only on `blink-context`, and `blink-export` adds only `serde_json`,
  which the workspace already carried.
- **Duplicate transitive versions** exist (`crossterm` 0.28/0.29,
  `windows-sys` 0.48/0.52/0.59/0.61, `hashbrown`, `mio`, `rustix`,
  `unicode-width`, `webpki-roots`) — all pulled in by *different* upstream
  crates (`ratatui` vs `indicatif`, etc.), not by Blink directly. They
  can't be unified without upstream alignment and aren't worth pinning
  around.
- **`fmt` / `clippy -D warnings` / `test`** are clean across the
  workspace; there is no dead code gated behind `#[allow]`.
- **Open, tracked separately:** GitHub Dependabot reports advisories on
  `main`. These are transitive and predate this phase; investigating them
  is its own task, noted in `docs/roadmap.md`. Note that `blink security`
  is *not* enough on its own to close that out: it checks the
  **declared** dependencies against OSV.dev, which on this workspace is 7
  packages, not the 236 in `Cargo.lock`. Running it here reports no known
  vulnerabilities — which is a narrower statement than Dependabot's, and
  the gap is the point.

## Cross-platform status

Path handling uses `PathBuf`/`std::path` throughout; the index normalizes
stored paths to `/` separators so an index is stable across OSes, and the
shell runner picks `cmd /C` on Windows and `sh -c` elsewhere. The release
matrix (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) builds macOS (x64/arm64), Linux
(x64/arm64), and Windows (x64). **This audit was run on Windows only;**
Linux/macOS behavior is covered by CI, not by a hand-run of every command
on those platforms.
